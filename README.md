# SnakeClone
A barely working snake clone with lots of mg assets used in game jam.
Tried using singletons, anumation players, audio players and some other things for the first time there.
Works as a prototype, no intentions on fixing it since its a bit more than a proof of concept.

Knows inssues:
1) Legal issues.
2) Restart button sometimes send restart signal twice freezing the game
3) Sound mixing is non existent
4) Controls are ducked with idiotic approach to input
